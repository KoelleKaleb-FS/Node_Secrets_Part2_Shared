# Node Secrets Management - Part 2: Shared Secrets File

This is the second part of a project demonstrating different approaches to managing secrets in a Node.js application. In this part, the application reads secrets from a shared `secrets.json` file. While this separates secrets from the codebase, it still has security risks.

---

## Description

The application uses a `secrets.json` file to manage sensitive information like API keys. This file is included in the repository, allowing the application to function without hardcoded secrets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
